 *Draw a circular spiral (as in the right screen capture of Fig. 7.27), using method
 *drawArc to draw one semicircle at a time. Each successive semicircle should have a larger
 *radius (as specified by the bounding rectangle’s width) and should continue drawing
 *where the previous semicircle finished.
